## Looking back at four years at Stripe ðŸ¥³

I'm currently sitting on this tiny Dutch Island called Schiermonnikoog (don't try to pronounce it, you'll have a sore throat for days!), looking out at the raindrops dancing in front of the window. It's a blissful, bikes-only island on which I've spent my childhood summers. The perfect place to reflect on the past couple of years at Stripe and spend some quality time with my family before moving to Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬
